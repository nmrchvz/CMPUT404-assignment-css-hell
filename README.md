This is a forked repo for the purpose of making a HTML and CSS as a CMPUT 404 assignment.

I declare that I have not collaborated with anyone on the completion of this assignment

Part 1 Modifications
====================
- Changed the colour scheme, font family, and font weight to something archaic and look outdated (yellow and brown tones)
- Removed all the `</script>` tags in each gutenberg html file.
- Created one .css file such that is it applied to all gutenberg html files. 
- Theme paragraphs, header tags, images and images captions with the specific colour scheme in the .css file 
- Changed indentation and alignment of the text
- Modified the hypertext links to redirect locally
- Added some `<hr>` tags to show when the eBook begins and ends
