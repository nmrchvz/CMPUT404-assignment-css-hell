        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>I am 21-year-old currently in my 4th year computing science undergraduate student studying at the University of Alberta
        As a full time student, I am interested in software engineering, game development, and web development. From individual 
        Python data-structure projects to fully functional Android applications made with other developers using an Agile Model; 
        I always strive to deliver an on-time and high-quality product which always results in positive feedback from my peers and
        course instructors. However, out side of school I have a passion for music and art. Music and art always refresh my 
        perspective from the usually logically and analytical thinking that is involved in programming. I hope one day I will be
        able use my creative perspective and programming knowledge to make something I am proud of.</p>
